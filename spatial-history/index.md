# The Journey of Burma Road
China underwent a drastic change during the beginning to the mid 20th century. After the collapse of the Imperial ruling dynasty in 1911, China was soon faced with the [Second Sino-Japanese war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War), from 1937 to 1945. By 1936, Japan started to move its main focus onto China. At that time, China was under the ruling of the Nationalist Government ([KMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang)) during the occupation. By 1938, the Japanese force occupied the majority of China and invaded Wuhan, the designated location of KMT, and forced the Nationalist Government to relocate to Chongqing.[^1] With the rising power of Japan, the West started to send forces to help to suppress the Japanese force in China. For instance, [Burma Road](http://www.chinarhyming.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Map-of-China-burma-road-Corbis.jpg), sponsored by the United States and United Kingdom, was one of the biggest economic and wartime resource supporters from the West to KMT government. Burma Road was a vital strategy constructed by US, UK and KMT in the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, Burma Road was not a frequently discussed topic regarding the event of the Second Sino-Japanese war. This paper will explore that Burma Road was inefficient due to its challenging landscape and location, and thus KMT prolonged the pushback of the Japanese force. Exploring the geographical descriptions of Burma Road could explain one of KMT’s difficulties to resist the Japanese force.

# Struggle of Burma
The following paragraph will briefly give the background information and the intention of the Burma Road construction. This can guide readers to further understand the vastness of the construction. The purpose of building the road was because during the occupation of Japan, Japan blocked all the major cities. By 1937, the leader of KMT, [Jiang Jie Shi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek), was negotiating with American General, [Joseph Stilwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stilwell), and the British government to design a plan to suppress the Japanese invasion. The biggest problem for UK and US in order to support China was that all the international channels connecting China to foreign countries were blocked by Japan. The only international gateway was Hong Kong, but the British decided that Hong Kong should not be involved[^2]. Therefore, Jiang and Stilwell proposed to build a channel that can connect China to the Western force. Both United States and United Kingdom decided that Burma and India could be the starting point of the the international channel. This way, the United States and the United Kingdom could directly export its resources to Burma and India, and then transport the resources into China. The construction began in 1937 and finished in 1938 and it was 1,800 kilometers[^3].

Furthermore, Burma Road was not a useful tactic to productively distribute resources from India and Burma to China due to its 1,800 kilometers long, seemingly endless, roads. The Burma Road was built along Burma, India, Chongqing, Guiyang and Kunming to defend China during the Second Sino-Japanese war from 1937 to 1942.[^4] This system was emerged to transport resource from United Kingdom and United States to India and Burma, then transfer to various stops Kuming, and Guiyang to the final destination at Chongqing, China[^5] (these location can be seen in the Google map). Often, scholars believed that the advantage of setting the final destination at Chongqing was that Chongqing was surrounded by isolated canyons and mountains, preventing from Japanese advancement.[^6] However, this advantage was also a disadvantage as well. Chongqing was located isolated areas along with difficult terrains and mountain roads, thus, it was inefficient to transport its sources swiftly. These war material aids were carried by the rail from Yangon, Burma to Kunming.[^7] As shown in the map, the distance between Burma to Kunming alone was over 900 miles, excluding any other distance traveled by trucks.[^8] The map demonstrated that the Burma Road started from British Burma and British India then linked all the way up to Chongqing and the areas of Japanese occupation (Japan occupied almost all the territory except cities like Guizhou, Kunming and Chongqing). It is clear that none of the other traditional Chinese ports were usable, and thus, they had to construct the Burma road way all the way from the southwest over to the mountains. Moreover, these sources needed to be transported by rail or truck on challenging landscapes such as terrains and mountains.

This further complicated the situation. By constructing the Burma system on intraversible terrains, it was nearly impossible to move sources from one point to another efficiently. The Burma Road was “important to the survival of Jiang’s government” by providing more than 20,000 tons of war materials and goods per month.[^9] However, the KMT cannot efficiently distribute its resources to other areas in China, because there was no access to land or sea.[^10] Additionally, the only transportation available by that time was by trucks or rail. By 1942, Japan injured over 10,000 British and Indian troops and 25,000 Chinese troops.[^11] As a result, the Burma Road was shut down in 1942. Although the abundant resources were supplied by the US and UK, the Burma Road transportation was not able to distribute its resources throughout China. The KMT government relied on US and UK’s constant support of resources, however, it is due to Chongqing's isolated location, and the vast transporting system of Burma Road, it was difficult to transport sources from Burma and India into China. Evidently, this led to the failure to quickly pushback the Japanese force until 1945.

In conclusion, by looking at the map of the Burma Road, it is clear that it was an inefficient way for the US and UK to supply China via 1,800 kilometers. This was one of the factors that contributed to the long last war of the Second Sino-Japanese.
