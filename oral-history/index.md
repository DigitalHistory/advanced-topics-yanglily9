This video tape was taken from Youtube.[^1] This oral clip was utilized by a Chinese Heritage non-profit organization called
Tucscon Chinese Cultural Center. The oral history was illustrated by Paul Wu, as a survivor of two major wars in Chinese
history, it demonstrated that China
was under political turmoil during the twentieth century. The hardship that the narrator described revealed that China
was under a political turmoil during the twentieth century. His escape from city to city, and eventually from Hongkong
to United States demonstrated the devastating effect of the two wars had on civilians. His narrative demonstrated the
hardship of Chinese civilians when they experience seemingly endless battles: the Second-Sino Japanese war occurred
between 1937 to 1945 and the Chinese civil War occurred between 1945 to 1950.[^first] In fact, the instability of China started
even before the two wars begun. Xihai Revolution was the turning point of Chinese history: this rebellion lead by Sun
Yat-sen and Yuan Shikai led to the collapse of the last imperial rule of China on 1911.The public sphere was filled
with excitement and anxiety.[^second] From 1905 to 1920s, it was period of warlord fight, where there were different warlords
starting to divide China’s territory.[^third] At the turn of the century, China’s political sphere was unstable.
The Nationalist Party (KMT), a republican government, aimed to unit China and created its own government in 1927.
However, the Chinese Communist Party also rose its power. By April 1927, the KMT and Chinese Communist Party(CCP) was
competing for power. However, the rivalry stopped when the Japanese force gradually invaded China, forcing the two
forces to focus on pushing back the Japanese force.

<a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(0)">Paul Wu born in 1938, illustrated his hardship as a survivor of the two wars that occurred in the mid-twentieth century
                                          China. </a>
                                 <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(19)"> In his early childhood, he noted that he was not sure what and why was China under turmoil and all he
                                                                           knew was that Japan was invading down from Manchuria all to way to Canton.</a> He illustrated that he moved to the
Western side of China to escape the turmoil, especially, after the Nanjing Massacre. As noted in Jonathan's text, the
massacre forced innocent citizens realized the devastating effect of the war.[^fourth] Wu live in Shanghai, which was the city
next to the Nanjing Massacre. This realization also forced Wu’s parents to escape from the Southern part of China and
move to the Western part of China. He noted that even from his childhood memory, he could still remember that the
journey to escape from city to city was extremely tough. He demonstrated that he was running like a refugee,
fearing for his life. <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(100)"> Throughout his escape, he could not settle into a place for too long: “sometimes you running,
                                                               sometimes you running, sometimes you catch a ride somewhere.”</a> This evidently demonstrated that human displacement
was one of the devastating effects of the war; in order to live, they had to run constantly, and nonstop. This human
displacement was worst when they had to run away from two wars. When the Japanese War ended, the Civil war started
again. This caused his family to lost everything: <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(135)">“running after two wars, your family fortune, family things,
                                                                                           it went dried, house, everything was gone.”</a> Additionally, he was never able to attend to school: “you go to
school for few months and then run, and go to another school, you have to run again.” This instability of political
uprisings within a country bolstered the theory human displacement forced families to experience war trauma and
it ultimately eradicate and alter the society and cultural norms.[^fifth] This human displacement was presented once again
when Wu discussed his escape to Hong Kong and San Francisco, USA. Hong Kong was under British rule from the first Opium
War until 1997;[^sixth] therefore, the Japanese force was not present in Hong Kong, leading to an estimation of ten million
immigrants from China to Hong Kong during the two wars.[^seventh] Evidently, this human displacement not only altered Chinese
society, but also Hong Kong. <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(193)"> Wu lived in Hong Kong from the age of eleven to seventeen. Later, he moved to
                                         San Francisco, USA via Presidential Line.</a>

In conclusion, Wu’s experience, escaping city to city and country,
demonstrated the devastating effect of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Civil War. This political turmoil led to
human displacement of Chinese civilians. Evidently, these two wars reshaped China and its citizens. Overall, this oral
history once again recounted the negative effect of the two wars from a personal experience.
